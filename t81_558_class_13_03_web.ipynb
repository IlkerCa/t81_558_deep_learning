This application is a single page web application that allows you to upload images for classification by the neural network.  If you would like to read more about ReactJS and image uploading, you can refer to the [blog post](http://www.hartzis.me/react-image-upload/) that provided some inspiration for this example.  I added neural network functionality to a simple ReactJS image upload and preview example.\n",
