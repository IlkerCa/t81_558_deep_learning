    "\n",
    "This assignment asks you to train a neural network to predict housing prices.  I provide you with two different datasets.  You will use one data set, which includes house prices for training.  A second dataset, which does not include house prices, will be used for prediction and be submitted for evaluation.  I also give you a third dataset that contains median income for zip codes that must be joined to both the training/test datasets to provide an additional input value.  You must use the median income with your inputs for extra predictive power.\n",

    "You can find all of the needed CSV files here:\n",

    "* [Median Income by Zipcode](https://data.heatonresearch.com/data/t81-558/datasets/zips.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "The median income by zipcode provides an additional feature, median income, that you should use in your predictions.  To complete this assignment perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load the housing prices training data.\n",
    "* Join the median income by zipcode to the training data so that you gain the median income.\n",
    "* Train a model to predict house price when given the following inputs: 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'garage', 'land', 'sqft', 'median_income'.\n",
    "* Load the housing prices test data.  This data does not contain the house price, you must predict this.\n",
    "* Join the median income by zipcode to the test/submit data to gain the median income.\n",
    "* Predict prices for the test/submit data.  \n",
    "* Create a submission dataset that contains the house id (from the test/submit data) and the predicted price for that house.  Include no other fields.\n",
    "* Submit this dataset and see how close you are to the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting the house prices with less than +/- $10,000 is sufficient to complete the assignment.  You may also wish to see if you can get your prediction even more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes/suggestions on this assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You will see really high loss rates, due to the face that the target value is the price of a house (which is a large number)\n",
    "* You might want to add a RMSE metric, which is the error in the same units target value. \n",
    "* I was able to obtain an RMSE of 86; yet still had a fairly high loss of 25920990.\n",
    "* To add RMSE as a metric:\n",
