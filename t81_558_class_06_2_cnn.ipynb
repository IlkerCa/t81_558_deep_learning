Fukushima  (1980) [[Cite:fukushima1980neocognitron]](https://www.rctn.org/bruno/public/papers/Fukushima1980.pdf) introduced the original concept of a convolutional neural network, and   LeCun, Bottou, Bengio & Haffner (1998) [[Cite:lecun1995convolutional]](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-bengio-95a.pdf) greatly improved this work. From this research, Yan LeCun introduced the famous LeNet-5 neural network architecture.  This chapter follows the LeNet-5 style of convolutional neural network.  \n",
        "Although computer vision primarily uses CNNs, this technology has some application outside of the field. You need to realize that if you want to utilize CNNs on non-visual data, you must find a way to encode your data so that it can mimic the properties of visual data.  \n",
        "\n",
        "CNNs are somewhat similar to the self-organizing map (SOM) architecture that we examined in Chapter 2, “Self-Organizing Maps.”  The order of the vector elements is crucial to the training. In contrast, most neural networks that are not CNNs or SOMs treat their input data as a long vector of values, and the order that you arrange the incoming features in this vector is irrelevant. For these types of neural networks, you cannot change the order after you have trained the network. In other words, CNNs and SOMs do not follow the standard treatment of input vectors. \n",
        "The SOM network arranged the inputs into a grid.  This arrangement worked well with images because the pixels in closer proximity to each other are important to each other.  Obviously, the order of pixels in an image is significant.  The human body is a relevant example of this type of order. For the design of the face, we are accustomed to eyes being near to each other.  In the same way, neural network types like SOMs adhere to an order of pixels. Consequently, they have many applications to computer vision. \n",

        "Scale, rotation, and noise have presented challenges in the past for AI computer vision research.  You can observe the complexity of biological eyes in the example that follows. A friend raises a sheet of paper with a large number written on it.  As your friend moves nearer to you, the number is still identifiable. In the same way, you can still identify the number when your friend rotates the paper.  Lastly, your friend creates noise by drawing lines on top of the page, but you can still identify the number. As you can see, these examples demonstrate the high function of the biological eye and allow you to understand better the research breakthrough of CNNs. That is, this neural network has the ability to process scale, rotation, and noise in the field of computer vision. This network structure can be seen in Figure 6.LENET.\n",

        "A filter is a square-shaped object that scans over the image. A grid can represent the individual pixels of a grid. You can think of the convolutional layer as a smaller grid that sweeps left to right over each row of the image. There is also a hyper parameter that specifies both the width and height of the square-shaped filter. The following figure shows this configuration in which you see the six convolutional filters sweeping over the image grid:\n",

Even though the image is actually 8x7, the extra padding provides a virtual image size of 9x8 for the filter to sweep across. The stride specifies the number of positions at which the convolutional filters will stop. The convolutional filters move to the right, advancing by the number of cells specified in the stride.

Furthermore, neither the stride, nor the convolutional filter size can be larger than the previous grid. There are additional constraints on the stride (s), padding (p) and the filter width (f) for an image of width (w). Specifically, the convolutional filter must be able to start at the far left or top boarder, move a certain number of strides, and land on the far right or bottom boarder.

Of these four pixels, the pixel with the maximum value will represent the 2x2 pixel in the new grid. Because squares of size 4 are replaced with size 1, 75% of the pixel information is lost.
